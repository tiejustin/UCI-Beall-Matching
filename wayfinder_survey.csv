Jaune was my advisor for the Blackstone LaunchPad TechStars Fellowship Program.

Shaka won first place in our division and Grand Prize in the 2021 New Venture Competition hosted by the Beall Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship.

I have attended speaker sessions hosted by the Beall Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship and Breanna Hale has made valuable introductions for my team.

",Shaka,Business Productivity,,No,,,,,Shaka is an online platform that helps companies keep their employees engaged whether they are working in the office or at home.,F_3elgJVhqJaTBbE2,orange-outline-logo-bold.png,12542,image/png,F_1IaQTWu3D4uGoTR,Shaka Shared Pitchdeck.pdf,6607196,application/pdf,,,,,,,,,F_2WSAybfRLljNUB8,Shaka Executive Summary.png,138575,image/png,,,,,F_vviKPVBxrlnAuNH,Shaka Business Model Canvas.pdf,151019,application/pdf,,,,,F_1mh0Bi7XAwcayf4,Shaka Financials.xlsx,223765,application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet,www.joinshaka.com,"Employee Disengagement:

In February of 2020, Gallup did a study that found that 65% of employees are not engaged at work. Over the past year, work from home has made it EVEN harder for companies to keep employees engaged. This is a BIG problem, in fact, employee disengagement costs the United States economy $450 Billion annually. But there is hope, companies that are successful in keeping their employees engaged are seeing 24% lower turnover, 21% higher productivity and 10% higher customer satisfaction. 
","Shaka is an online platform that keeps employees engaged whether they are working in the office or at home. We currently drive employee engagement through three online features 

1. Shaka Connections which pairs employees for 20-minute internal networking meetings at the frequency of their choice. We take the work out of networking by integrating with Google and Outlook calendars to automatically schedule these meetings and provide conversation starters. 

2. Shaka communities which helps employees find colleagues with mutual interests or backgrounds to them. Fostering a sense of belonging and creating more leadership opportunities within the company culture. 

3. Shaka Challenges which boosts team camaraderie while promoting employee wellness, learning and development or philanthropic efforts.
","There are other players in the employee engagement space. They can be easily classified into 2 groups:
1. Softwares that drive engagement (Donut, Espresso, Cultr, Workplace, Yammer)
2. Softwares that measure engagement (TinyPulse, CultureIQ, CultureAmp, Peakon)

We are looking to differentiate our product by offering multiple features that employees will love in order to drive engagement while simultaneously giving companies more analytical insights into employee sentiment and relationship networks than they have ever had before. 

Because a tool that can measure engagement, identify risks and then drive engagement activities based on the analysis all within one platform will be significantly more powerful than anything that is on the market today. ","The evidence I have to support that people will pay for my product is that we already have paying customers that were landed through cold email outreach they are using the platform today and are giving us great feedback.

I have spoken with hundreds of HR professionals and business leaders when trying to understand the problems in the market. 

We built our current offering for companies with 50-1000 employees. Based on our market research we plan to initially target Technology companies with multiple offices or remote employees and those companies that have recently raised funding or are experiencing high growth are really feeling this pains that Shaka can aims to resolve. 

There are over 136,000 companies in the US with 50-1000 employees. 22,000 of those are in the tech industry and based on our forecasts we believe we can capture 1,800 of them by 2025. In terms of dollars this is an initial TAM of $2.5 Billion dollars and $31.8 M of Bookings captured by 2025. 
","We wrote a proprietary pairing algorithm that we use in our Shaka Connections feature to intelligent match employees who have likely not interacted before based on different criteria such as their tenure, department, location and Shaka pairing history.

My goal is to raise a $750,000 seed round no later than January of 2021 to hire a customer support specialist and additional software developers to build the mobile application (we are currently web based) and Shaka analytics features. In 2023 we will raise a $1M+ Seed round which will bring us to profitability.","We have over 300 users across 3 companies, 2 of which are paying us a monthly subscription fee. The HR professionals who implemented Shaka at their companies are saying that Shaka has been a great addition, it has helped their employees get better acquainted and that they are THRILLED with the participation.

Shaka was selected by Blackstone and Techstars as part of their student Technology Startup Fellowship Program. This is a very competitive fellowship where we were connected with mentors and leaders of both Blackstone and Techstars and had weekly workshops and milestone deliverables.

As I previously mentioned, we won the 2021 New Venture Competition which was awesome for Shaka!

Shaka haas been highlighted in UCI Media, the OC Business Journal and I recently recorded 2 podcasts as a guest about HR and Company Culture where I was able to speak about Shaka to their trusted audiences. Those 2 podcast episodes air in July.","1. Create a firm product roadmap with timelines, goals and costs. This roadmap will bring Shaka to market as soon as possible but not before the platform is ready to support user growth so as not to risk the user-experience of our early adopters.
2. Set up all legal documents needed to protect Shaka and our customers in the future. Cap Table, Master Services Agreements, Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Channel Partnership Agreements and LLC filing all need to be reviewed.
3. Prepare to fundraise. As I mentioned, our goal is to raise $750,000 by January at the latest. I need to develop a list of VCs and angels who invest in pre-seed business that could be great fits for Shaka. I will then develop an outreach strategy & messaging content. Lastly, I will create an execution timeline so that my fundraise seems urgent but has enough time to reach the goal.","I am in need of mentors with a background in HR or Organizational Psychology. I sell into this market but it is not my background so mentors who could help me better reach my future clientele via strategic outreach and messaging would be very valuable. If there are mentors with a legal background, that would be huge for Shaka. I am not sure that the documents I created are sufficient for client agreements at scale. I would love to network with angels and venture capitalists, I do not have a strong network of connections in this space and I fear it will hinder me during fundraising. Lastly, the office space will help me attract more serious team members onto our founding team and give us a productive, professional space to work.","HR/Organizational Psychology

This is something that they are unable to get anywhere else.","There are over 5,000 weekly in-person open mics in the US and 40% of those are located in California and New York. On a very conservative estimate, 5-10 comedians participate in each mic. This equates to 25,000 or more comedians working on their comedic skills each week. 

Weâ€™ve conducted exploratory interviews with comedians who've participated in either in-person, online, or both types of mics. We have found that they are seeking real-time feedback, ways to improve their performance, and expanding their reach outside of their local market.
